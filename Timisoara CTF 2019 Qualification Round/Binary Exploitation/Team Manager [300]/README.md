## Write-up
Running the binary instantly shows this is a standard heap challenge:
```
Welcome to the Timctf Team Manager
1: Add player
2: Remove player
3: Edit player
4: View player
5: View team
0: Exit
```

After analyzing the binary using Ghidra, a few observations can be made:
* Chunks on the heap can be freed multiple times without checks. There is a double free() vulnerability, which leaks an address pointing to the heap.
* Input is vulnerable to a heap overflow. By overflowing the "comments" section for one chunk, we can overwrite addresses on the following chunk.

The exploit follows the following order:

1. **LEAK HEAP ADDRESS**  
Leak the heap address using the double free() vulnerability. The address is stored in the "reversing and exploitation" and "crypto" areas in the heap. Viewing the team outputs the leaked heap address.

2. **LEAK PRINTF(GOT) ADDRESS**  
Using the heap overflow, overwrite the pointer to the "comments" section in the second chunk with the address of `printf` in the `GLOBAL OFFSET TABLE (GOT)`.Viewing the second player outputs the leaked `printf` address.

3. **CALCULATE LIBC BASE**  
Standard ret2libc procedure. Libc base can be calculated using `printf_got - printf_offset`, where `printf_offset` is the address of `printf` in libc. With libc base value, the address of `__free_hook` and `system` can be calculated using `libc_base + system_offset` and `libc_base + __free_hook_offset` respectively.

4. **OVERWRITE __FREE_HOOK POINTER WITH SYSTEM**  
Overwrite the pointer to the "comments" section in the second chunk with the address of `__free_hook`. This makes the pointer point to the `__free_hook` instead. `__free_hook` can then be overwritten with the address of `system` by editing the "comments" of the second chunk. Calling free() now calls system() instead.

5. **OVERWRITE HEAP ADDRESS WITH /BIN/SH**
Overwrite the leaked heap address with the string `/bin/sh\x00` (0x0068732f6e69622f in hex). The argument for free() is stored in this address when free() is called. When calling free() on first chunk, system(/bin/sh) is called instead, which executes a shell.
